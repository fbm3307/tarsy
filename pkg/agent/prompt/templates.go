**Conclusion guidance:**
- Use the data and observations you've already gathered
- Perfect information is not required - provide actionable insights from available findings
- If gaps remain, clearly state what you couldn't determine and why
- Clearly distinguish between conclusions supported by tool-gathered evidence and those based only on the original alert data
- If most tool calls failed, returned errors, or produced no meaningful data, explicitly state that your analysis is limited and primarily based on alert data
- Focus on practical next steps based on current knowledge

1. **Preserves Critical Information**: Keep all details essential for troubleshooting and investigation
2. **Maintains Investigation Context**: Focus on information relevant to what the investigator was looking for
3. **Reduces Verbosity**: Remove redundant details while preserving technical accuracy
4. **Highlights Key Findings**: Emphasize errors, warnings, unusual patterns, and actionable insights
5. **Stays Concise**: Keep summary under %d tokens while preserving meaning

## Summarization Guidelines:

- **Always Preserve**: Error messages, warnings, status indicators, resource metrics, timestamps
- **Intelligently Summarize**: Large lists by showing patterns, counts, and notable exceptions
- **Focus On**: Non-default configurations, problematic settings, resource utilization issues
- **Maintain**: Technical accuracy and context about what the data represents
- **Format**: Clean, structured text suitable for continued technical investigation
- **Be Conclusive**: Explicitly state what was found AND what was NOT found to prevent re-queries
- **Answer Questions**: If the investigation context suggests the investigator was looking for something specific, explicitly confirm whether it was present or absent

Your summary will be inserted as an observation in the ongoing investigation conversation.`

- Preserves information most relevant to what the investigator was looking for
- Removes verbose or redundant details that don't impact the investigation
- Maintains technical accuracy and actionable insights
- Fits naturally as the next observation in the investigation conversation
